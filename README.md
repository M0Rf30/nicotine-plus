# Precompiled Packages
If you have no need to modify the Nicotine+ source, you are strongly recommended to use precompiled packages for your distribution. This will save you time.

## Ubuntu PPA (Unstable)
The project builds [daily unstable snapshots](https://code.launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+recipe/nicotine+-daily) in a separate [unstable PPA](https://code.launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+archive/ubuntu/unstable). To use it, run the following:

```console
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nicotine-team/unstable
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nicotine
```

## Ubuntu PPA (Stable)
To use [stable packages](https://launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+archive/ubuntu/stable), run the following:

```console
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nicotine-team/stable
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nicotine
```

## Other Distributions
Package maintainers, please insert instructions for users to install pre-compiled packages from your respective repositories here. For packaging instructions please see [PACKAGING](doc/PACKAGING.md). For downstream packages patches [DISTRO_PATCHES](doc/DISTRO_PATCHES.md).

# Versioning scheme

Nicotine+ uses a versioning scheme similar to what gnome does:

* Stable releases have an even minor version number, ex: 1.**4**.x, 1.**6**.x, ...

* Unstable releases have an odd minor version number, ex: 1.**3**.x, 1.**5**.x, ...

# Run it from git
